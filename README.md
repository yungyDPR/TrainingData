# Training datasets for training GROBID sale catalogues models

Each directory of this repository contains datasets created to train GROBID sale catalogues models. Datasets are divided based on where original documents are being kept, and then are organized by authors/auction houses.

Annotated files are in the [TEI-XML](https://tei-c.org/) format.

## Naming convention

* BnF files are named with their Gallica ark identifier.
* INHA files are named with their digital identifier ("identifiant numérique") provided in their online notice.

## GROBID models

* Segmentation : the segmentation model aims to obtain a high level segmentation of the catalogues. 

## Data quality

Before being pushed to the main branch, annotated files have at least been proofread once.
